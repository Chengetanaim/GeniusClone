# Cloning Genius using TailwindCSS - https://genius.com/

### What is Genius?

Genius is my go-to website when I'm searching for lyrics. As someone who is profoundly obsessed with music (rap, trap, hip-hop), I find most of my time opening this website to get clarification on what's being said by the musicians I listen to, and maybe learn a thing or two. My favourite part is their annotations on certain lines. As rap is an art, and music as a whole, there are lingo's, entendre's, word play and artistry that cannot be conveyed by the simple ear/mind. Which is why I heavily depend on this website for that kind of stuff.

### Why Clone Genius?

Now I don't think there's any further explanation as to why I cloned this website, rather than the fact that I'm always using it, and I believe doing projects is the best way to learn a new skill in programming. Whenever I'm practicing a new skill I feel like I'm in control of that skill, which is what programming is all about really (telling the computer what to do).
